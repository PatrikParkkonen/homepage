            <p>Hello, I'm Patrik! I'm 27 years old, and I'm currently studying at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences. I have completed every regular course needed for my degree. All that remains is a thesis project as well as my job practice. I love all kinds of programming and development, so I'm happy to learn just about anything and do my best. I'm very open-minded and work well both alone and in teams. I have experience in Javascript, Java, Python, React (and React Native), as well as SpringBoot, SQL, and node. Most of my experience comes from university projects, though I have some personal projects as well, some of which can be found on my github. Links to my github and linkedin can be found in the footer below. Outside of developing and coding, my hobbies include biking and photography. If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to email me at patrik.parkkonen@gmail.com</p>
