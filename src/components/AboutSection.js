            <p>Hello, I'm Patrik Parkkonen. I'm 27 years old, and I'm currently studying Information Technology at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences. I have completed every course required for my degree, with the exception of my thesis and job practice. I love all kinds of programming and development, so I'm eager and happy to learn more. I'm very open-minded and work well both alone and in teams. I have experience in Javascript, Java, Python, React (and React Native), as well as SpringBoot, SQL, and node. Most of my experience comes from university projects, though I have some personal projects as well. Some of these projects can be found in my github. Links to my github and linkedin can be found in the footer below. Outside of developing and coding, my hobbies include biking and photography. I love nature in general. If you'd like to get in touch, please contact me at patrik.parkkonen@gmail.com</p>
