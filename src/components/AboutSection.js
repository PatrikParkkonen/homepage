            <p>Hello, I'm Patrik Parkkonen. I'm 30 years old, and I've recently graduated as a Bachelor of Business Information Technology at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences. I love all kinds of programming and development, so I'm eager and happy to learn more. I'm very open-minded and work well both alone and in teams. I have experience in Javascript, React, HTML, CSS, node, Robot Framework, and Cypress through previous work experience. I also have some experience of Java, Python, SpringBoot, and SQL through coursework and personal projects. Some of these projects can be found on my Github. Links to my Github and LinkedIn can be found in the footer below. Outside of developing and coding, my hobbies include biking and photography. I love nature in general, and enjoy being outside. If you'd like to get in touch, please contact me at patrik.parkkonen@gmail.com</p>
