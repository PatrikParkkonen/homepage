# A homepage/portfolio website using ReactJS

This is a personal project to practice ReactJS. It's a website to show off some basic ReactJS while also functioning as a personal homepage with my portfolio, resume, etc. I'm building the site slowly, using various online tutorials to help. Future plans include a transition into Material UI, as well as various testing libraries. The website has also been deployed to Heroku, and can be viewed [here.](https://patrik-homepage.herokuapp.com/)
